Hello,
I'm Ahmadul from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Currently doing my masters in microelectronics and microsystems in Technical University of Hamburg. My specialization is in image signal processing. It's a multidisciplinary course where knowledge about image analysis, computer vision, pattern recognition and machine learning is needed. In my free time, I play football or dabble in music.
